## Simple Web Stack — Solution
### Scenario:
A user opens their web browser and enters www.foobar.com into the address bar. The browser initiates a request to access the website hosted on a server that has been configured using a simple web stack.

### Infrastructure Design
This infrastructure is composed of:

1 Server
A single virtual or physical machine that hosts all components: web server, application server, application files, and database.

1 Web Server (Nginx)
Handles HTTP requests, serves static content (HTML, CSS, JS), and acts as a reverse proxy to forward dynamic requests to the application server.

1 Application Server
Executes the application logic written in a server-side language (e.g., PHP, Python, or Node.js).

1 Application Codebase
Contains the website source code (e.g., dynamic content generation, routing, business logic).

1 Database (MySQL)
Stores and manages the website’s data, including user information, product listings, and any other structured content.

1 Domain Name: foobar.com
A domain name configured with a www record (A record) that points to the IP address 8.8.8.8, where the server is hosted.
### Component Explanations
What is a Server?
A server is a powerful computer designed to provide services or resources to other computers (clients) over a network. In web infrastructure, it hosts websites and responds to client (user) requests.

What is the Role of the Domain Name?
The domain name (foobar.com) serves as a human-readable address that maps to the server’s IP address, making it easier for users to access the website without remembering numeric IPs.

What Type of DNS Record is www in www.foobar.com?
The www in www.foobar.com is a DNS A (Address) Record, which maps the www subdomain to the IP address 8.8.8.8.

What is the Role of the Web Server (Nginx)?

Listens for incoming HTTP(S) requests.

Serves static files like HTML, CSS, images.

Forwards dynamic requests to the application server using reverse proxy configuration.

What is the Role of the Application Server?
The application server processes dynamic requests by executing backend code, handling user sessions, and interacting with the database to fetch or store information.

What is the Role of the Database?
The database (MySQL) stores all persistent data required by the application. It allows for data retrieval, manipulation, and storage using structured queries (SQL).

What Does the Server Use to Communicate with the User's Computer?
The server uses the HTTP/HTTPS protocol to communicate with the client (user's browser), transferring data over TCP/IP networks.
